# RDR2 Photo Mode Converter

#### How to use

Default path of the Photo Mode file will be found in

`C:\Users\User\Documents\Rockstar Games\Red Dead Redemption 2\Profiles`


Then, just run the command directly. (No matter where you place the python file.)
It's gonna create a folder name `Photo` under the default path, including all the converted images.

`python converter.py`


You can change the default path by passing argument.

`python converter.py your/own/path/to/RDR2/profile`
